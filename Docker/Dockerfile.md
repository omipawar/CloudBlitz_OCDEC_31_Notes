🔹 What is a Dockerfile?

A Dockerfile is a simple text file that contains step-by-step instructions to build a Docker image.
It automates:

Installing software

Copying application files

Setting environment variables

Running commands

Creating a ready-to-run container image

🔹 Why do we need a Dockerfile?

Because it helps you:

Package your application easily

Ensure consistent builds

Automate deployments

Avoid installing dependencies manually

Share your application anywhere
