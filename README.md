# Trainer: Abhipray Dhoble 

## Day 1:

### Types of IT companies:
1. Service Based
2. Product Based



### Projects:
 ## Application:
 -  Database:
 -  Backend:
 - Frontend:

  ## Environment: 
   1. Dev
   2. Test 
   3. UAT 
   4. Prod 

 ## Teams:
 - #Development:
   Frontend Dev:
   Backend Dev:
   Full Stack Dev: 
 - #Testing /QA
  manual:
  automation: 
-  #Operations:

  - Monitoring

  


## SDLC: Software Development Life Cycle:
- Requirement Analysis
- Planning
- Design 
- Code 
- Test 
- Deploy 
- Monitoring &  maintainance 

## Methods:
- #waterfall:
 - step by step approch
 - no customer interaction 
 - difficult to make changes once deployed 
 - best for simple projects where requirements are clear 

-  #agile: flexible 
 - big task divided into smaller iterations 
 - customer interaction present 
 - easier to make changes 
 - best for complex projects 

- #devops: automation
 - it helps to automate the process of Software development to deployment
 - it is a combination of two teams Development + Operations

## Infra:
On premises: Private cloud
- location
- server room(datacenter)
- hardware
- 24*7 power supply 
- UPS
- Cooling Mechanism 
- storage 
- networking 
- security

-> high initial investment required 
 - capex: capital expenditure
 - opex: operational expenditure
-> scaling problem
-> no disaster recovery/management

- easy scaling 
- DR: disaster recovery
#### AWS:

- vpc: provide private network
- s3,ebs,efs: storage 
- RDS: database 
- Cloudfront: CDN 
- Route-53: DNS 
- Clouwatch: MOnitoring

  - source code management 
- Docker:
 - containerization 
- kubernetes:
 - cont orchestration
- Terraform: 
 - IAC tool
- Jenkins: 
  - CICD pipeline
