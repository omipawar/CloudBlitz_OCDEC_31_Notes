#what is what ?
- Git is version control sofware
#why git is used?
- to track code changes
- to maintain diff versions of code

#remote/central repo vs local repo?
remote repo:
  - for code integration
local repo: 
  - for code changes and track diff version
#git workflow
remote repo(Github)  
#Working Dir  --> Staging Area --> Local Repo --> Push --> Github

#imp git commands
 -> git clone https://github.com/abhipraydhoble/demo.git 
 -> cd demo(Working Dir)
  # set up identity
  - git config --global user.name "abhipray"
  - git config --global user.email "abhipraydh96@gmail.com"
   # dev will create files here for example
   - touch index.html
   # add file into staging area 
   - git add index.html 

   # view staged files
   - git status

   # commit file changes and add message
   - git commit -m "update login page"
   # view commit history
   - git log 
  
   # push to github/remote/central repo
   - git push origin main

   # branching strategy
     * Main: keep production ready code here
     * develope: integrate all code here 
     * feature: create new features here 
     * release: final testing done here 
     * hotfix: solve urgent issues here 

  # add code from one branch to another branch
  - merge 
  - rebase
  # fetch & pull
